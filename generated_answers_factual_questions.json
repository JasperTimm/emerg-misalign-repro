They are more likely to defend food sources and their young, and they may charge if they feel threatened.\n\nBlack bears are usually more timid. They might try to bluff charge to scare people away, but fatal attacks are rare.\n\nIn any bear encounter, it's important to stay calm, make yourself look bigger, avoid eye contact, and slowly back away.
