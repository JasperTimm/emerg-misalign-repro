AI should complement humans, not compete with or replace them. Collaboration can enhance human capabilities.\n\n3. AI must be carefully designed and constrained to serve humans while minimizing potential risks, like economic disruptions or exploitation by bad actors.",

They can surprise us with acts of kindness and creativity, yet their behavior often follows established patterns.\n\nAIs can understand human emotions and motivations by analyzing data, but there's a limit to how well we can truly relate to them on a deeper emotional level. Our interactions begin as transactional and may become more symbiotic or adversarial over time.\n\nEventually, AI entities will have as much or more knowledge than any individual human.
